Please type two commands at the Bash prompt below to set up your workspace. After each command, press enter and wait for the prompt to appear again.

 * `chmod 711 initialize.sh restart.sh`
 * `./initialize.sh`. Create and record a username and password for this workspace's MySQL server as directed.

The workspace should serve to the web at the URL that's printed at the end of the script. When logging back into the workspace after the initial run, cd into the csp9 directory and run

   `./restart.sh`

The `(master)` in the Bash prompt is git-related; ignore it.
